# CS5800 Final Project - Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver

This project provides a set of algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using different strategies, including Greedy, Held-Karp, and Ant Colony Optimization approaches. The TSP is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science and operations research that focuses on optimization. The goal is to determine the shortest possible route that visits a set of nodes exactly once and returns to the original node.

## Features

-   Dynamic distance matrix generation using Google Maps API.
-   Implementation of Greedy Solver for a quick and efficient solution.
-   Implementation of the dynamic programming-based Held-Karp Solver for an exact solution.
-   Implementation of Ant Colony Solver as a heuristic that simulates the behavior of ants to find solutions.
-   Performance comparison of different algorithms.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

-   Python 3.6 or above
-   Google Maps API key

The required Python libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`. To install them, run the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
